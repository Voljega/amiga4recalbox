	That install applies to Desert Dream, 1993 Kefrens (2 disks).


	That install requires WHDLoad (at least version 1.1) and DIC to be in
	the path.  Both can be found in the WHDLoad package.  To install from
	a different drive than DF0:  select Expert as installation mode.


	You need 1.0 MB ChipMem and 0.5 MB OtherMem.
	You  can  quit  the  game  by  pressing  F10 (key can be changed with
	Tooltype "QuitKey=").


	What you get:
	- Track loaders patched,
	- Illegal memory accesses before 5 balls effect fixed,
	- Support for hidden part, hold left mouse button to boot from second
	  disk, then after screen flash do the magic =)

	Bugs:
	- Crap on the "Insert Disk 2" picture (probably WHDLoad problem),
	- Some snooping problems...


	Thanks  must  go Mr Larmer/Wanted Team for support and of course Bert
	Jahn for great WHDLoad.
